            <p>
                Welcome to Split Space, 
                where we believe that sharing the cost of housing should be simple, transparent, and 
                beneficial for everyone involved. Our mission is to create a platform that brings
                individuals together to collaboratively share the expenses of comfortable living
                spaces, fostering a sense of community and financial ease.
            </p>
        <h1>Our Vision<br>
            <button class="lines"></button></h1>
        
            <p>
                At SplitSpace, we envision a future where the burden of housing costs is
                lightened through shared responsibility. We aim to create network of like-minded individuals who recognize the value of corporate living and the positive
                impact it can have on both their wallets and overall well-being.
